This is a note to my future self about which Lua constructs (with their names as in LuaMinify code) create a new scope,
and where in the tree structures to get names of these newly introduced variables (it might come useful during minification) 
FunctionStatement -> obj.name (might be nil!)
NumericForStatement -> obj.var
GenericForStatement -> obj.var_list (table)
LocalStatement -> obj.names (table)
